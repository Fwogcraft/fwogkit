Minecraft Mod Pack for the Fwogcraft community modded server.

This is the 1.15.2 version of the modpack used for the Fwogcraft Modded server, but will be updated to 1.16 once there's a stable release.

It is a [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/) modpack built and managed with [packwiz](https://github.com/comp500/packwiz) and suitable for installation into [MultiMC](https://multimc.org/)

This pack has been heavily inspired by the [AOF-Mini](https://github.com/AllOfFabric/AOF-Mini) and [All-of-Fabric-2](https://github.com/AllOfFabric/All-of-Fabric-2) modpacks.

If using this pack with MultiMC, you'll need to manually install Fabric after installing the pack.

## Installing

We have a detailed [Installation Guide](https://github.com/Fwogcraft/fwogkit/wiki/Installation) for the modpack and its prerequisites here to help you get started.
